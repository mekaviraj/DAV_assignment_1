## 📌 Features

### ✅ Data Loading & Cleaning
- Dropped missing/null values
- Converted string dates into `datetime` objects
- Handled duplicates and formatted categorical columns

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Group-wise analysis using `groupby()`
- Multi-index pivot tables for business insights
- Correlation analysis

### ✅ Visualizations
- Histogram of Sales Distribution
- Barplot: Deal Size vs Total Sales
- Scatterplot: Quantity Ordered vs Price Each (hue by Deal Size)
- Boxplot: Sales across Quarters
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Line plot of cumulative revenue by month

### ✅ Bonus Operations
- Derived new columns like `PROFIT`, `REVENUE`, etc.
- Z-score normalization for selected numerical columns
- Boolean indexing and conditional filtering
- Rolling mean of monthly sales
- Identifying top customers and top-performing product lines

## 📈 Key Findings

- 💰 **Mid-size deals** generate the most revenue overall.
- 📦 Higher order quantities often correspond with **discounted unit prices**.
- 📊 Seasonal trends suggest **Q4 has the highest sales**.
- 🏆 Certain product lines (e.g., **Classic Cars**, **Motorcycles**) significantly outperform others in profit and volume.
- 🌍 Sales vary notably by **territory and country**, useful for regional marketing strategies.
